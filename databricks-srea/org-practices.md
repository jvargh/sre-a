# Organization Cloud Practices

This document defines our company's mandatory security, cost, and operational practices for Azure resources. All resources must comply with these standards.

## Security Practices

### Network Security Groups (NSGs)

**Critical Requirements:**

*   \*\*Never allow SSH (port 22) from 0.0.0.0/0 or \*\*\* - All SSH access must be restricted to specific IP ranges or use Azure Bastion
*   \*\*Never allow RDP (port 3389) from 0.0.0.0/0 or \*\*\* - All RDP access must be restricted to corporate VPN IP ranges or use Azure Bastion
*   **No unrestricted inbound rules** - Every inbound rule must have a specific source IP or CIDR range
*   **Deny rules take priority** - Explicit deny rules should be in place for sensitive ports

**Remediation:**

*   Replace `*` or `0.0.0.0/0` source with specific IP ranges
*   Use Azure Bastion for administrative access
*   Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) VM access

### Key Vault Secrets

**Critical Requirements:**

*   **Secrets must not expire within 30 days** - All secrets should be rotated before they reach 30-day expiration window
*   **Secrets expiring in 30-60 days** - Warning level, schedule rotation
*   **No secrets without expiration dates** - All secrets must have an expiration date set
*   **Enable soft delete and purge protection** - Required for all production Key Vaults

**Remediation:**

*   Rotate secrets before expiration
*   Implement automated secret rotation using Azure Automation or Key Vault auto-rotation
*   Set expiration dates on all secrets (maximum 1 year)

### Private DNS Zones

**Critical Requirements:**

*   **All Private DNS Zones must be linked to their associated VNet** - Unlinked zones break private endpoint resolution
*   **Use auto-registration only when appropriate** - Avoid conflicts with multiple VNets

**Remediation:**

*   Create VNet links for all Private DNS Zones
*   Verify private endpoint connectivity after linking

### Storage Accounts

**Critical Requirements:**

*   **Disable public blob access** - `allowBlobPublicAccess: false`
*   **Disable shared key access** - Use Azure AD authentication only (`allowSharedKeyAccess: false`)
*   **Require HTTPS** - `supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true`
*   **Minimum TLS 1.2** - `minimumTlsVersion: TLS1_2`
*   **Enable soft delete for blobs** - Minimum 7 days retention

**Remediation:**

*   Update storage account properties to meet requirements
*   Migrate applications to use managed identity authentication

### App Service / Web Apps

**Critical Requirements:**

*   **HTTPS only** - HTTP must redirect to HTTPS
*   **Use managed identity** - No hardcoded credentials
*   **Enable VNet integration for internal resources** - Apps accessing internal resources must use VNet integration
*   **Minimum TLS 1.2** - For all HTTPS connections

## Cost Practices

### Tagging Requirements

**Mandatory Tags for ALL Resources:**

| Tag Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cost-center` | Yes | Finance cost center code (e.g., "engineering", "marketing") |
| `owner` | Yes | Team or individual responsible (e.g., "platform-team") |
| `environment` | Yes | dev, staging, prod |
| `project` | Recommended | Project or application name |

**Enforcement:**

*   Resources missing `cost-center` or `owner` tags are flagged for remediation
*   Untagged resources older than 7 days should be investigated for deletion

### Virtual Machines

**Right-sizing Requirements:**

*   **CPU utilization \< 5% for 14+ days** - VM is considered idle, evaluate for deletion or downsizing
*   **CPU utilization \< 20% average** - VM is underutilized, consider downsizing
*   **Use appropriate VM series** - Don't use premium series (D-series) for dev/test workloads
*   **Use Spot VMs for batch workloads** - When interruption is acceptable
*   **Reserved Instances** - Commit to 1-year or 3-year reservations for stable production workloads

**Recommended Actions:**

*   Idle VMs (\< 5% CPU): Delete or stop
*   Underutilized VMs (\< 20% CPU): Downsize by one tier
*   Batch workloads: Convert to Spot VMs

### Orphaned Resources

**Resources to Monitor:**

*   **Unattached Managed Disks** - Disks not attached to any VM for 7+ days should be deleted or snapshotted
*   **Unused Public IPs** - Public IPs not associated with any resource
*   **Empty Resource Groups** - Resource groups with no resources
*   **Stopped VMs** - VMs in deallocated state for 30+ days (still incur storage costs)
*   **Unattached NICs** - Network interfaces not attached to VMs

**Remediation:**

*   Review orphaned resources weekly
*   Delete or archive unused resources
*   Create snapshots before deleting disks if data may be needed

### Storage Optimization

**Requirements:**

*   **Use appropriate access tiers** - Archive for rarely accessed, Cool for infrequent, Hot for frequent
*   **Enable lifecycle management** - Auto-tier blobs based on access patterns
*   **Delete old snapshots** - Snapshots older than 90 days should be reviewed

## Operational Practices

### Monitoring

**Required for All Production Resources:**

*   Enable Azure Monitor diagnostics
*   Configure alerts for critical metrics
*   Send logs to Log Analytics workspace

### Backup

**Requirements:**

*   All production VMs must have Azure Backup enabled
*   Databases must have point-in-time restore configured
*   Test restore procedures quarterly
